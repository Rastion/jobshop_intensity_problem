    "description": "In the job shop scheduling problem with intensity, a set of jobs must be processed on every machine of the shop. Each job consists of an ordered sequence of tasks (activities), one per machine. Each task has a given processing time; however, the progress of a task depends on the machine's intensity over time â€“ an intensity of 0 means the machine is off, and at each time step, an ongoing task's progress increases by the machine's current intensity. A task is complete when the cumulative intensity since its start reaches its processing time. Tasks in a job must follow a specified processing order, and each machine processes tasks in a sequence defined by the candidate solution. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e. the time when all jobs have been processed.",
